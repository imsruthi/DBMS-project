# Database Management System for Healthcare
Project Name:Database Management System for Healthcare

Description:
This GitHub repository showcases a comprehensive database management system designed for the healthcare industry. It encompasses the efficient management of appointments, doctors, patients, and prescriptions, supported by SQL database design and Tableau data visualization. The project caters to healthcare administrators, doctors, and patients, streamlining the processes of appointment scheduling and patient management. It includes a robust database schema, SQL implementation, and Tableau visualization to facilitate data-driven decision-making in healthcare.

Key Highlights:
Use-case:The database management system serves healthcare facilities by automating appointment scheduling, patient information management, and prescription tracking.
End-Users:Healthcare administrators, doctors, and patients are the primary end-users. Administrators benefit from streamlined operations, doctors have access to patient data, and patients can view their appointments and prescriptions.
Cost Model:This project is open-source and free to use, facilitating access to healthcare management tools without cost constraints.

My Connection:
As a database designer and developer, I took on this project as part of my academic journey during my Master's degree. It's a culmination of my skills in database design, SQL implementation, and data visualization using Tableau. I've chosen to showcase this project to demonstrate my proficiency in these areas and provide a valuable resource for healthcare management professionals.

Table Design and Analysis:
The project includes tables for appointments, doctors, patients, prescriptions, and specialization. These tables are interconnected to create a seamless database structure, enabling efficient healthcare management.

Database Implementation:
The repository contains SQL commands for data retrieval and updates, representing key business rules and real-world scenarios, such as patient registration and appointment scheduling.

Analytics and Reports:
Examples of analytics and reports that can be conducted on the database are included, allowing users to derive insights from the healthcare data.

Security Concerns:
The project considers data security and privacy, as healthcare data is sensitive. It adheres to best practices for securing and managing sensitive information.

Architecture:
This project is intended for small to medium-sized healthcare facilities and can be hosted on-premises or in a cloud-based environment, depending on the organization's requirements.

Through this project, I've gained a deeper understanding of database design, SQL implementation, and data visualization. The importance of data security in healthcare and the potential impact of data-driven decision-making have been key takeaways.
